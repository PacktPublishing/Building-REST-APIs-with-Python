## About the Video Course
With the growing demand for full-stack developers, it is important to learn how you can combine the powers of Python with other libraries to create amazing applications.

Django has basic front-end support but we show how complex operations can be performed at the front-end. We show you how to unleash the power of Python's Rest API and other functionalities to create compelling applications powered by ReactJS.

We will be using a production-level database such as Postgres. Delving into key aspects such as code reusability, deployment and maintaining your application, we discuss production server configuration and bundle technologies with Python to provide an end-to-end web development solution.
